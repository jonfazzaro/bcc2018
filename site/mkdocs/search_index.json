This tends to decrease the person's sense of opportunity from and commitment to the team's work.\n\n\nBring your whole selves to work, to the team. This doesn't mean interfering in the work of the team by espousing your radical political opinions so much as it means stop spending energy/cycles on \nconcealing\n them and keeping them from influencing your choices.

Not robust/durable--those things only resist damage when stressed. \n\n\nIf something is the opposite of \"fragile\", it gets \nstronger\n under stress. \nAntifragile\n.\n\n\nEustress\n, the good kind of stress.\n\nModerate, not extreme.\n\nPeriodic, not chronic.\n\nLike good exercise.\n\n\nVolatility\n\n\nThe restaurant industry is volatile. It's a difficult business to run. Restaurants are closing (and new ones are opening) all the time. The upshot: there's always somewhere to go to lunch.\n\n\nThe banking industry is not volatile. It's highly regulated, and has the appearance of stability. The upshot: when something goes wrong, it goes very wrong, and the effects \nripple through the whole economy\n.\n\n\nMore examples\n\n\nMartin Luther King, Jr.'s 1963 \"I have a dream\" speech was improvised. He was faltering in delivering his prepared remarks, but when Mahalia Jackson prompted him from the crowd to \"\nTell them about the dream, Martin!\n\", the words that everyone remembers came flooding in. \n\n\nNetflix's \nChaos Monkey\n, of course.\n\n\nDynamic Reteaming\n\n\nProcrustean Bed\n\n\n\n\nA Procrustean bed is an arbitrary standard to which exact conformity is forced. Named for \nProcrustes\n, the bandit from Greek mythology who stretched or amputated the limbs of travelers to make them conform to the length of his bed.\n\n\n\n\nTeams\n\n\nMost of the groups we call \u201cteams\u201d are probably better described as \u201cworking groups\u201d. \n@mkeCharlie\n \n#antifragile\n \n#beercitycode\n Fazzaro (@jonfazzaro) \nJune 23, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA \nworking group\n is a collection of \nindependent\n individuals applying effort to the same work.\n\n\nA \nteam\n is an \ninterdependent\n, interactive group who's value is greater than the sum of its parts.\n\n\nIf you want to build an actual team  \n\n\nDON'T use \nthe 5U method\n of building a team: \"Okay, you, you, you, you, and you! You're a team.\"\n\n\nDO define \nwho is on the team\n and \nwho is not on the team\n explicitly. Set clear expectations and drawing clear boundaries, these constraints free both parties to do better work and collaborate more effectively.\n\n\nPsychological Safety\n is the most important prerequisite to a great team.\n\n\nAmy Edmonson\n's Questions\n\n\nFor identifying whether your team is psychologically safe.\n\n\n\n\nIf you make a mistake on this team, will it is be held against you?  \n\n\nAre members of this team able to bring up problems and tough issues?  \n\n\nDo people on this team sometimes reject others for being different?  \n\n\nIs it safe to take risk on this team?  \n\n\nIs it difficult to ask other members of this team for help?  \n\n\nWould anyone on the team deliberately act in a way that undermines efforts?  \n\n\nWorking with members of this team, are unique skills and talents are valued and utilized? \n\n\n\n\n(Maybe we should use these in a retrospective?)\n\n\nBTW: A \nknowledge worker\n is a person who knows how to do their job better than their manager does.\n\n\nAntifragile Teams\n\n\nVia Negativa\n\n\n\n\na way of describing something by saying what it is not, especially denying that any finite concept of attribute can be identified with or used of God or ultimate reality.\n\n\n\n\nSo, what can we STOP doing that will make our team more Antifragile? \n\n\n\n\nPremature over-standardiztion\n\n\nMetrics for managers (they're for the team!)\n\n\nHaving a separate support development team \n\n\ndeprives the support devs of working on the new hotness\n\n\ndenies the tiger team exposure to the results of their actions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLong-lived teams\n\n\n\n\nAnd what can we START doing?\n\n\n\n\nThe job of an Agile Coach is to grow the team by keeping them in eustress\n\n\nEmbrace volatility, rather than avoiding it\n\n\nEstablish psychological safety\n\n\nPush \"\npower to the edges\n\"--establish the goal and direction, but defer decisions down to the team.\n\n\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nAntifragile\n\n\nThe Wisdom of Teams\n\n\nPerformance note\n. Charlie frequently \nturned off the slides\n while talking. This was an excellent use of negative space during his talk. It removed the subtle distraction of an irrelevant slide when he was speaking about something that he did not necessarily have a visual for. It was super-effective.\n\n\nWhat I've learned interviewing more than 200 people face to face\n\n\nwith \nMichael Stahnke\n\n\nWhen deciding on a candidate, ask: \"If you only got to hire one person this year, would this person be it?\"\n\n\nMake a \nScorecard\n for the job.\n\n1. Define success for the role in terms of outcomes.\n\n2. Write the job description based on that.  \n\n\nDiversity and inclusion begin at the hiring pipeline, in the wording of the job description. ~ Michael Stahnke \n#BeerCityCode\n Fazzaro (@jonfazzaro) \nJune 23, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure that the interview panel isn't ALL WHITE DUDES. Observe how the candidate treats/relates to the interviewers who are female/non-white/etc.\n\n\nScrap the \"culture\" interview--that's how you find a friend, not fill a job.\n\n\nInterview questions\n\n\"Tell me about a time you pushed back on management.\"\n\n\"Tell me about something you did that you are really proud of.\"\n\n\nAfter the interview, with you fellow interviewers:  \n\n\n\n\nHave a gladiator-style thumbs-up/down vote.  \n\n\nRetrospect on the interview process.  \n\n\n\n\nPut your evaluation of the candidate in writing\n. This is good for two reasons:  \n\n\n\n\nWriting makes you and your team think through what otherwise might be a flip/emotional/gut decision  \n\n\nHaving your reasoning in writing is good legal protection in case a rejected applicant attempts litigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplicant tracking\n\n\nJobscore\n\n\nGreenhouse\n  \n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nWho\n\n\nUrban Legends: What You Code Makes You Who You Are\n\n\nwith \nPJ Hagerty\n\n\nOur developer communities are too siloed.
