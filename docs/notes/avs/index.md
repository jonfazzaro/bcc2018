## Real Prioritization and Collaboration Strategies 

with [Jim Benson](https://twitter.com/ourfounder)

**Zeigarnik Effect**: once we begin a task, we can't NOT be thinking about it.

"Individuals and interactions _through_ processes and tools."

Organize your options (your backlog) using the Cynefin framework (obvious, complex, complicated, or chaotic).

Chaotic: FIRE! Put it out, then analyze immediately 
Obvious: delegate or automate as much as possible
Complex/Complicated: spend your attention here. Pair, mob, teach, and learn through the work

### Improvement 

**Anti-pattern: Rosy Retrospection**. The longer you wait to retrospect on an problem, the more you will discount how bad it really was.

Add **Retrospect** and **We Need To Talk** columns after Done on your board. 

Place items that you learned something from in **Retrospect**, to reflect on later and cement the lesson. This is _periodic improvement_.

Place drastic (chaotic/FIRE) items into **We Need To Talk** after **Done**. Don't wait to retrospect on these, do it as soon as things are stable. This is _continuous improvement_.


## High-Performance Teams: Core Protocols for Psychological Safety and EI

with [Richard Kasperowski](https://twitter.com/rkasper)

Ask yourself: "What is the best team you were ever on?" What was it about that team that made it great? Probably trust, safety, and fun.

We mostly ascribe these factors to luck. They just happened to put the right people together. It's a roll of the dice. **But These things can be fostered on purpose for any team!**

Team Emotional Intelligence (TEI) ->  
Psychological Safety (PS) ->   
High-Performing Team (HPT)

### Core Protocols

Team Emotional Intelligence can be formed/enhanced through the use of the **Core Protocols**. 

+ success patterns for interactions between people
+ discovered in a similar way to PS from Project Aristotle: they were *naturally occuring behaviors observed on existing High-Performing Teams*.
+ they create a level of safety that can liberate a team's power of collective genius

A **High-Performing Team** performs *objectively* better than other teams doing similar work. (It's not intangible or subjective!)

It's quickly [becoming standard](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/four-key-metrics) to measure (software) teams using the four key metrics from DevOps (deployment frequency, lead time, MTBF, and MTTR).

Aspects of HPT:

#### Positive Bias

+ no negation (yes, and)
+ even when they disagree with an idea, they *pretend* it is valuable at first
	+ to make space to explore it (curiosity!) and 
	+ to not discourage ideation in the future

Respect for team members' ideas unlocks the team's genius.

#### Freedom

Freedom is the basis of any great culture. HPT members have freedom. (This includes the freedom to not be on a HPT!)

**Protocols**: [Pass/Unpass](https://thecoreprotocols.org/protocols/pass.html), [Check out](https://thecoreprotocols.org/protocols/checkout.html). A team member may opt out of any activity (pairing/mobbing, a protocol, a meeting). This is not to say that this won't have consequences for them and the team, just that they are free to choose.

#### Self-awareness

**Protocols**: [Check-in](https://thecoreprotocols.org/protocols/checkin.html), [Ask for help](https://thecoreprotocols.org/protocols/askforhelp.html), [Personal Alignment](https://thecoreprotocols.org/protocols/personalalignment.html).

Try a Check-in as a "fourth question" in your next Daily Scrum.

**Personal Alignment**: "I want ____." This is way open-ended. If it stumps you, try [narrowing the possible responses](https://thecoreprotocols.org/applications/personalalignmentexpress.html) to a list of virtues:

+ Self-Awareness (default; if you don’t know what you want, you want self-awareness)
+ Integrity
+ Courage
+ Passion
+ Peace
+ Presence
+ Self-Care
+ Fun
+ Wisdom
+ Health

#### Connection

**Protocols**: Self-awareness ([Check-in](https://thecoreprotocols.org/protocols/checkin.html), [Ask for help](https://thecoreprotocols.org/protocols/askforhelp.html), [Personal Alignment](https://thecoreprotocols.org/protocols/personalalignment.html)) plus [Intention Check](https://thecoreprotocols.org/protocols/intentioncheck.html) and [Investigate](https://thecoreprotocols.org/protocols/investigate.html).

**Intention Check**: "When you did/said ____, what was your intention?" -> "I'm curious--will you tell me more about ___?"

It may make people uncomfortable to say, but an HPT is founded on LOVE. Connection is a big part of that.

#### Productivity

The [Decider](https://thecoreprotocols.org/protocols/decider.html) protocol (thumbs up/down, flat hand). 

In the case of a thumbs down, the voter can offer a suggestion that would get them to a thumbs-up.

The flat hand indicates that you trust the team's collective judgement either way.

#### Error Handling

"A HPT navigates conflict."

One of the protocols is a [Protocol Check](https://thecoreprotocols.org/protocols/protocolcheck.html)--error handling is baked in.

### Continuous Teaming

A team that uses the Core Protocols is continuously integrating their team, actively fostering the above qualities of HPT.



## Management in Agile

with [Peter Green](https://twitter.com/tptman)

[VUCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility,_uncertainty,_complexity_and_ambiguity) (Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, Ambiguous)

### Parker Palmer's [*Tragic Gap*](https://www.awakin.org/read/view.php?tid=776) 

We realize that things are not as they should be, and respond in two ways: 

1. **Caustic Cynicism**, in which we leverage the system's weakness to our personal advantage
1. **Ineffective Idealism**, in which we get caught up in hope, but take no action.

Both of which (ironically) lead to the same result. In order to actually move the system forward, Palmer asserts that we should instead **Stand in the Gap**.

### David Marquet's [*Turn The Ship Around*](https://www.amazon.com/Turn-Ship-Around-Turning-Followers/dp/1591846404/?s=books&keywords=leadership#ace-4302123154) 

The poorest performing ship turned things around when Marquet stopped giving orders. Instead, staff brought their ideas to him:

1. I intend to ____.
1. I've done the following due dilligence: ____.
1. Here's how it aligns with our vision/mission/strategy: ____.

These map directly to Pink's factors of motivation (Autonomy, Mastery, and Purpose, respectively).

**Problems and work in a complex domain are dependent on context.** We cannot simply copy processes/procedures from one complex domain and expect them to work in another. (See also [Cargo Cult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult)) 

### The Three Jobs of Management

If we're no longer giving orders, what do we need to trust the team to make the right decisions? 

+ We need **Clarity** between the team and the org on what work we have to do
+ We need the team to be **Competent** and **Capable**.
+ We need the team to surface **Information** that will help to improve the org.

This forms the focus for the work of managers in an Agile organization:

**Create Clarity**  
**Increase Capability**  
**Improve the System**

As much as possible, *let the teams themselves be responsible* for things that don't fall neatly under these headings.

#### Along Two Dimensions

The Three Jobs apply along both the **Human** and the **Objective** dimension. Examples of how work maps to these jobs and dimensions:

![](img/ThreeJobsofAgileManagement.png)

#### Overlap with other roles

There is some overlap in this work with Scrum roles. A Product Owner will work to *Create Clarity* around their product, for instance. A Scrum Master would certainly be involved in *Improving the System* and *Increasing Capability* (especially on the Human dimension).

Managers should partner closely with PO/SM for Scrum Teams whose members report to them. For example, when *Creating Clarity*, the manager and PO may collaborate on setting the team's Purpose, Mission, and Vision, while the PO would take on Strategy, Customer Segmentation, and managing the Product Backlog on their own.

### What if I'm not a manager?

You can still use the Three Jobs to own the work you do have a say in, while working to expand your influence.

Q: *How does this work with SaFE?*   
A: "I have yet to see it work" for the Complex domain, it seems better suited for Complicated work ("I don't know this, but we have an expert who does").

Q: *Where's the line between the work of a Scrum Master and a Manager?*  
A: It depends on the team's capabilities.

### Leadership Agility model

Managers progress from **Expert** to **Achiever** to **Catalyst**. (Does this line up with [ShuHaRi](https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/ShuHaRi.html)?)

## The Power of the Pivot: Agile companies are built for times like these

with [Howard Sublett](https://twitter.com/howardsublett)

+ The earliest maps from history show complete certainty about the world, an attempt to convey the authority of the person who made the map.
+ When people got over themselves and began indicating areas of uncertainty on their maps (thar be dragons), it sparked a sense of adventure for people to begin exploring. 
+ Saying "here's something we don't know" in public leads to *action*.

### Draw Your Seamonsters

+ declare what you don't know
+ push decision-making to the edges/front lines of your organization, so your people are inspired to explore!

## A Deeper Dive into the ScrumMaster Role

with [Richard Cheng](https://www.scrumalliance.org/community/profile/rcheng2)

### Five qualities to look for in a Scrum Master/Agile Team Coach

1. Knowledge
1. Experience
1. Coaching
1. Facilitation
1. Servant Leadership

> A good Scrum Master is always on the verge of getting fired.

&mdash;Ken Schwaber

(This is likely because a good Scrum Master has to be able to be direct and have [difficult conversations](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/difficult-conversations/id1345042626?i=1000475171939) with managers and leaders.)

[Scrum Master checklist](https://scrummasterchecklist.org/pdf/ScrumMaster_Checklist_12_unbranded.pdf)

### How to evaluate the work of a Scrum Master?

#### How is the Product Owner doing?

+ Is the Product Backlog clear and in good order?
+ Are they setting effective Sprint Goals?
+ Are they transparent with the Stakeholders and Team (on their vision, roadmap, progress, etc.)?
+ Are they balancing feature delivery with the reduction of technical debt and other risks?

#### How is the team doing?

+ Are they using good agile engineering practices? (TDD, automation, pairing, etc.)
+ Do they self-organize and collaborate well?
+ How do they rank on the [DevOps Four Key Metrics](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/four-key-metrics)?

#### How is the organization doing?

+ Are communication barriers between departments or other silos coming down?
+ This is typically Agile Coach territory, but the Scrum Master should still have a seat at the table.

### The Scrum Master job

Is it a full-time job? **Yes**.  
Should a Scrum Master work across multiple teams? **No**. (Remember that **Focus** is a Scrum value)

#### Filling more than one Scrum role 
*Scrum Master*, *Product Owner*, and *Development Team member* are three different skillsets/mindsets.

Can a Product Owner become a good Scrum Master? Yes, but only once they have unlearned the Command and Control mindset and embraced Servant Leadership.

#### Is the Scrum Master doing a good job?

+ Is the team repeatedly making the same mistakes (production bugs, overplanned sprints, etc.)?
+ Is the team repeatedly encountering the same issues (external to the team)?

Or, are they *improving*?

#### Scrum Master's Progression for Solving a Problem

1. Did it come up in the Retrospective?
1. Did you discuss its impact?
1. Did you identify the root cause(s)?
1. Did you propose a solution?
1. Did you try it?
1. What were the results?
1. What can you do next?

### Q+A

**On The Agile Coach/Scrum Master relationship**: In general, an Agile Coach should coach Scrum Masters on their work with teams, and partner with them on organizational issues. It is not recommended for Scrum Masters to report to an Agile Coach.

**On Scrum Mastering while remote**: Using the right tool(s) have become much more important in remote work--keep it simple, though. Also, create and maintain good Working Agreements.

**On breaking into the Scrum Master scene**: jump onto a team and get started!

The Scrum Master doesn't stop their team from failing. Rather, they ensure that the team *learns* from their failures.

## Are We Really a Team?

with [Chris Li](https://www.linkedin.com/in/realchrisli)

A team is a small number of people (<10) with:

+ complementary skills,
+ a common purpose,
+ a common working approach,
+ common performance goals, and
+ mutual accountability to one another

### Complementary Skills
+ the right *mix* of skills 
+ technical skills, BUT ALSO skills in 
	+ problem solving, 
	+ decision making, and 
	+ personal interaction

### A Common Purpose
+ sets the tone for the team's work
+ a source of motivation

### A Common Working Approach
+ developed together by the team, not imposed from outside (eg, by a manager)

### Common Performance Goals
+ should be tied to purpose
+ behaviors and habits are more effective than target metrics

### Mutual Accountability
+ promises the team members make to each other
+ rooted in commitment and trust (not blame!)

> By promising to hold ourselves accountable to the team's goals, we each earn the right to express our own views about all aspects of the team's effort and to have our views receive a fair and constructive hearing.

### [The Five Dysfunctions of a Team](https://bookshop.org/books/the-five-dysfunctions-of-a-team-a-leadership-fable-9780787960759/9780787960759)

#### Be *vulnerable* around one another

Without **Trust**, team members cannot have transparency and the effective communication that comes along with it. 

(Not "trust" as in, "I trust you to get this done" or "I trust you to do a good job". If you trust someone, you can be *vulnerable* and *open* with them.)

#### Passionately debate the *important* stuff

Without **Conflict** (AKA *Creative Tension*), there can be no unfiltered passionate debate. **Without Conflict, people's best ideas are not available to the team**.

#### Make decisions with *clarity* and *confidence*

Without **Commitment**, the team will delay making decisions and taking action. 

#### Call each other out *when it's needed*

Without **Accountability**, resentment will grow within the team, and their leader/manager will become overburdened with babysitting duties.

#### Focus on winning *as a team*

**A team succeeds and fails together**.  
"I got *my* stories done" == "The hole is on *your* side of the boat"

### Q+A

Imagine bringing a new person onto your team. If that person asked you about your team's purpose (or workflow, or performance goals, etc.), how would you answer? How would your teammates answer? Do this thought experiment *before* you actually have a new team member to onboard.

"Human APIs" between teams

When someone behaves badly, and their colleagues say "oh, that's just how they are", *that's a smell*. 

## How Limits Empower Your Agility

with [Diana Larsen](https://twitter.com/DianaOfPortland)

Bob Martin has shown how programming has advanced over decades thanks to increasingly *stricter* limits in programming languages. Structured programming, OOP, and FP each introduced constraints that allowed programmers to focus on adding capability rather than on mitigating errors.

Larsen's premise here is that the same principle, that constraints enhance capability, applies to your team's agility as well.

Did you know? The term "Knowledge Work" was coined by Peter Drucker.

### The [Agile Fluency](https://agilefluency.org) model

**Fluency = unconscious competence.**   
The skill/attribute comes naturally, rather than as the result of applied effort. This is the result of consistent practice!

**Pre-agile**: Command and control, work (as tasks) is assigned to workers  by managers. Decisions come from the top-down.

**Focusing**: The team thinks and plans in terms of the benefits their sponsors, customers, and users will see from their software. Scrum, non-technical XP

**Delivering**: The team can release their latest work, at minimal risk and cost, whenever the business desires. DevOps, CI/CD, XP, Kanban

**Optimizing**: The team understands what their market wants, what your business needs, and how to meet those needs. 

> One of the biggest challenges in enabling Optimizing fluency is giving the team true control over its product direction. The distinction between an Optimizing team and a Delivering team is that, within the constraints of its charter, the Optimizing team makes its own decisions about what to fund and where to focus their efforts. Managers need to delegate this power to teams, which is often a difficult change for organizations.

This stage is particularly disruptive to traditional organizations. It often requires reorganization and the political will to make it happen. Titles, promotional paths, etc. get shaken up. 

Leaders tend to like it; middle managers tend to fear it.

**Strengthening**: The team understands its role in the larger organizational system and actively works to make that system more successful. The future of agile. (Sometimes marked by cutting-edge techniques like *Team Self-selection* and *Open Space strategy meetings*)

#### Each of these zones adds limitations.

For example,

+ Product Backlog size
+ User Story size
+ Work in progress
+ Working done individually
+ Reteaming
+ Decision-making by managers
+ Functional departments/silos

...are all limited in an Agile environment.

#### When undergoing an Agile Transformation

**LIMIT** your organization's focus to improving one of these zones at a time.

**Think of each new limit as a tradeoff.**  
"We're giving up ____ for ____."

+ WIP for Throughput
+ Feature count for quality
+ Control for resilience
+ Certainty for innovation

> When you argue with reality, you lose, but only 100% of the time.

[Byron Katie](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/132449-when-you-srgue-with-reality-you-lose-but-only-100)

**Understand the organization's reality and its limitations** when choosing the level of fluency to target.

**Don't impose change from the outside**. By involving people in the creation of an improvement plan, you create buy-in and motivation to carry it through.

### Q+A

#### Cynefin

> **Simple / Obvious**: Problems are easy to solve and have one best solution. You can categorise and say, “Oh, it’s one of those problems.”
> 
> **Complicated**: Often made up of parts which add together predictably. Requires expertise to solve. You can **analyse** this problem if you have the expertise.
> 
> **Complex**: Properties emerge as a result of the interactions of the parts. Cause and effect are only correlated in retrospect. Problems must be approached by experiment, or **probe**. Both outcomes and practices emerge.
> 
> **Chaos**: Resolves itself quickly, and not always in your favour. Often disastrous and to be avoided, but can also be entered deliberately (a shallow dive into chaos) to help generate innovation. Problems need someone to act quickly. Throwing constraints around the problem can help move it into complexity. Practices which come from this space are novel.
> 
> **Disorder**: We don’t know which domain dominates, so we behave according to our preferred domain (think PMs demanding predictability even when we’re doing something very new that we’ve never done before, or devs reinventing the wheel rather than getting an off-the-shelf library). Often leads to chaos when the domain resolves (I know least about this domain, but it’s way more important than I originally thought it was!)
