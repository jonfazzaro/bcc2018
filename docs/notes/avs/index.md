## Real Prioritization and Collaboration Strategies 

with [Jim Benson](@ourfounder)

**Zeigarnik Effect**: once we begin a task, we can't NOT be thinking about it.

"Individuals and interactions _through_ processes and tools."

Organize your options (your backlog) using the Cynefin framework (obvious, complex, complicated, or chaotic).

Chaotic: FIRE! Put it out, then analyze immediately 
Obvious: delegate or automate as much as possible
Complex/Complicated: spend your attention here. Pair, mob, teach, and learn through the work

### Improvement 

**Anti-pattern: Rosy Retrospection**. The longer you wait to retrospect on an problem, the more you will discount how bad it really was.

Add **Retrospect** and **We Need To Talk** columns after Done on your board. 

Place items that you learned something from in **Retrospect**, to reflect on later and cement the lesson. This is _periodic improvement_.

Place drastic (chaotic/FIRE) items into **We Need To Talk** after **Done**. Don't wait to retrospect on these, do it as soon as things are stable. This is _continuous improvement_.


## High-Performance Teams: Core Protocols for Psychological Safety and EI

with [Richard Kasperowski](@rkasper)

Ask yourself: "What is the best team you were ever on?" What was it about that team that made it great? Probably trust, safety, and fun.

We mostly ascribe these factors to luck. They just happened to put the right people together. It's a roll of the dice. **But These things can be fostered on purpose for any team!**

Team Emotional Intelligence (TEI) ->  
Psychological Safety (PS) ->   
High-Performing Team (HPT)

### Core Protocols

Team Emotional Intelligence can be formed/enhanced through the use of the **Core Protocols**. 

+ success patterns for interactions between people
+ discovered in a similar way to PS from Project Aristotle: they were *naturally occuring behaviors observed on existing High-Performing Teams*.
+ they create a level of safety that can liberate a team's power of collective genius

A **High-Performing Team** performs *objectively* better than other teams doing similar work. (It's not intangible or subjective!)

It's quickly [becoming standard](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/four-key-metrics) to measure (software) teams using the four key metrics from DevOps (deployment frequency, lead time, MTBF, and MTTR).

Aspects of HPT:

#### Positive Bias

+ no negation (yes, and)
+ even when they disagree with an idea, they *pretend* it is valuable at first
	+ to make space to explore it (curiosity!) and 
	+ to not discourage ideation in the future

Respect for team members' ideas unlocks the team's genius.

#### Freedom

Freedom is the basis of any great culture. HPT members have freedom. (This includes the freedom to not be on a HPT!)

**Protocols**: [Pass/Unpass](https://thecoreprotocols.org/protocols/pass.html), [Check out](https://thecoreprotocols.org/protocols/checkout.html). A team member may opt out of any activity (pairing/mobbing, a protocol, a meeting). This is not to say that this won't have consequences for them and the team, just that they are free to choose.

#### Self-awareness

**Protocols**: [Check-in](https://thecoreprotocols.org/protocols/checkin.html), [Ask for help](https://thecoreprotocols.org/protocols/askforhelp.html), [Personal Alignment](https://thecoreprotocols.org/protocols/personalalignment.html).

Try a Check-in as a "fourth question" in your next Daily Scrum.

**Personal Alignment**: "I want ____." This is way open-ended. If it stumps you, try [narrowing the possible responses](https://thecoreprotocols.org/applications/personalalignmentexpress.html) to a list of virtues:

+ Self-Awareness (default; if you donâ€™t know what you want, you want self-awareness)
+ Integrity
+ Courage
+ Passion
+ Peace
+ Presence
+ Self-Care
+ Fun
+ Wisdom
+ Health

#### Connection

**Protocols**: Self-awareness ([Check-in](https://thecoreprotocols.org/protocols/checkin.html), [Ask for help](https://thecoreprotocols.org/protocols/askforhelp.html), [Personal Alignment](https://thecoreprotocols.org/protocols/personalalignment.html)) plus [Intention Check](https://thecoreprotocols.org/protocols/intentioncheck.html) and [Investigate](https://thecoreprotocols.org/protocols/investigate.html).

**Intention Check**: "When you did/said ____, what was your intention?" -> "I'm curious--will you tell me more about ___?"

It may make people uncomfortable to say, but an HPT is founded on LOVE. Connection is a big part of that.

#### Productivity

The [Decider](https://thecoreprotocols.org/protocols/decider.html) protocol (thumbs up/down, flat hand). 

In the case of a thumbs down, the voter can offer a suggestion that would get them to a thumbs-up.

The flat hand indicates that you trust the team's collective judgement either way.

#### Error Handling

"A HPT navigates conflict."

One of the protocols is a [Protocol Check](https://thecoreprotocols.org/protocols/protocolcheck.html)--error handling is baked in.

### Continuous Teaming

A team that uses the Core Protocols is continuously integrating their team, actively fostering the above qualities of HPT.
