## Real Prioritization and Collaboration Strategies 

with [Jim Benson](https://twitter.com/ourfounder)

**Zeigarnik Effect**: once we begin a task, we can't NOT be thinking about it.

"Individuals and interactions _through_ processes and tools."

Organize your options (your backlog) using the Cynefin framework (obvious, complex, complicated, or chaotic).

Chaotic: FIRE! Put it out, then analyze immediately 
Obvious: delegate or automate as much as possible
Complex/Complicated: spend your attention here. Pair, mob, teach, and learn through the work

### Improvement 

**Anti-pattern: Rosy Retrospection**. The longer you wait to retrospect on an problem, the more you will discount how bad it really was.

Add **Retrospect** and **We Need To Talk** columns after Done on your board. 

Place items that you learned something from in **Retrospect**, to reflect on later and cement the lesson. This is _periodic improvement_.

Place drastic (chaotic/FIRE) items into **We Need To Talk** after **Done**. Don't wait to retrospect on these, do it as soon as things are stable. This is _continuous improvement_.


## High-Performance Teams: Core Protocols for Psychological Safety and EI

with [Richard Kasperowski](https://twitter.com/rkasper)

Ask yourself: "What is the best team you were ever on?" What was it about that team that made it great? Probably trust, safety, and fun.

We mostly ascribe these factors to luck. They just happened to put the right people together. It's a roll of the dice. **But These things can be fostered on purpose for any team!**

Team Emotional Intelligence (TEI) ->  
Psychological Safety (PS) ->   
High-Performing Team (HPT)

### Core Protocols

Team Emotional Intelligence can be formed/enhanced through the use of the **Core Protocols**. 

+ success patterns for interactions between people
+ discovered in a similar way to PS from Project Aristotle: they were *naturally occuring behaviors observed on existing High-Performing Teams*.
+ they create a level of safety that can liberate a team's power of collective genius

A **High-Performing Team** performs *objectively* better than other teams doing similar work. (It's not intangible or subjective!)

It's quickly [becoming standard](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/four-key-metrics) to measure (software) teams using the four key metrics from DevOps (deployment frequency, lead time, MTBF, and MTTR).

Aspects of HPT:

#### Positive Bias

+ no negation (yes, and)
+ even when they disagree with an idea, they *pretend* it is valuable at first
	+ to make space to explore it (curiosity!) and 
	+ to not discourage ideation in the future

Respect for team members' ideas unlocks the team's genius.

#### Freedom

Freedom is the basis of any great culture. HPT members have freedom. (This includes the freedom to not be on a HPT!)

**Protocols**: [Pass/Unpass](https://thecoreprotocols.org/protocols/pass.html), [Check out](https://thecoreprotocols.org/protocols/checkout.html). A team member may opt out of any activity (pairing/mobbing, a protocol, a meeting). This is not to say that this won't have consequences for them and the team, just that they are free to choose.

#### Self-awareness

**Protocols**: [Check-in](https://thecoreprotocols.org/protocols/checkin.html), [Ask for help](https://thecoreprotocols.org/protocols/askforhelp.html), [Personal Alignment](https://thecoreprotocols.org/protocols/personalalignment.html).

Try a Check-in as a "fourth question" in your next Daily Scrum.

**Personal Alignment**: "I want ____." This is way open-ended. If it stumps you, try [narrowing the possible responses](https://thecoreprotocols.org/applications/personalalignmentexpress.html) to a list of virtues:

+ Self-Awareness (default; if you donâ€™t know what you want, you want self-awareness)
+ Integrity
+ Courage
+ Passion
+ Peace
+ Presence
+ Self-Care
+ Fun
+ Wisdom
+ Health

#### Connection

**Protocols**: Self-awareness ([Check-in](https://thecoreprotocols.org/protocols/checkin.html), [Ask for help](https://thecoreprotocols.org/protocols/askforhelp.html), [Personal Alignment](https://thecoreprotocols.org/protocols/personalalignment.html)) plus [Intention Check](https://thecoreprotocols.org/protocols/intentioncheck.html) and [Investigate](https://thecoreprotocols.org/protocols/investigate.html).

**Intention Check**: "When you did/said ____, what was your intention?" -> "I'm curious--will you tell me more about ___?"

It may make people uncomfortable to say, but an HPT is founded on LOVE. Connection is a big part of that.

#### Productivity

The [Decider](https://thecoreprotocols.org/protocols/decider.html) protocol (thumbs up/down, flat hand). 

In the case of a thumbs down, the voter can offer a suggestion that would get them to a thumbs-up.

The flat hand indicates that you trust the team's collective judgement either way.

#### Error Handling

"A HPT navigates conflict."

One of the protocols is a [Protocol Check](https://thecoreprotocols.org/protocols/protocolcheck.html)--error handling is baked in.

### Continuous Teaming

A team that uses the Core Protocols is continuously integrating their team, actively fostering the above qualities of HPT.



## Management in Agile

with [Peter Green](https://twitter.com/tptman)

[VUCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility,_uncertainty,_complexity_and_ambiguity) (Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, Ambiguous)

### Parker Palmer's [*Tragic Gap*](https://www.awakin.org/read/view.php?tid=776) 

We realize that things are not as they should be, and respond in two ways: 

1. **Caustic Cynicism**, in which we leverage the system's weakness to our personal advantage
1. **Ineffective Idealism**, in which we get caught up in hope, but take no action.

Both of which (ironically) lead to the same result. In order to actually move the system forward, Palmer asserts that we should instead **Stand in the Gap**.

### David Marquet's [*Turn The Ship Around*](https://www.amazon.com/Turn-Ship-Around-Turning-Followers/dp/1591846404/?s=books&keywords=leadership#ace-4302123154) 

The poorest performing ship turned things around when Marquet stopped giving orders. Instead, staff brought their ideas to him:

1. I intend to ____.
1. I've done the following due dilligence: ____.
1. Here's how it aligns with our vision/mission/strategy: ____.

These map directly to Pink's factors of motivation (Autonomy, Mastery, and Purpose, respectively).

**Problems and work in a complex domain are dependent on context.** We cannot simply copy processes/procedures from one complex domain and expect them to work in another. (See also [Cargo Cult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult)) 

### The Three Jobs of Management

If we're no longer giving orders, what do we need to trust the team to make the right decisions? 

+ We need **Clarity** between the team and the org on what work we have to do
+ We need the team to be **Competent** and **Capable**.
+ We need the team to surface **Information** that will help to improve the org.

This forms the focus for the work of managers in an Agile organization:

**Create Clarity**  
**Increase Capability**  
**Improve the System**

As much as possible, *let the teams themselves be responsible* for things that don't fall neatly under these headings.

#### Along Two Dimensions

The Three Jobs apply along both the **Human** and the **Objective** dimension. Examples of how work maps to these jobs and dimensions:

![](img/ThreeJobsofAgileManagement.png)

#### Overlap with other roles

There is some overlap in this work with Scrum roles. A Product Owner will work to *Create Clarity* around their product, for instance. A Scrum Master would certainly be involved in *Improving the System* and *Increasing Capability* (especially on the Human dimension).

Managers should partner closely with PO/SM for Scrum Teams whose members report to them. For example, when *Creating Clarity*, the manager and PO may collaborate on setting the team's Purpose, Mission, and Vision, while the PO would take on Strategy, Customer Segmentation, and managing the Product Backlog on their own.

### What if I'm not a manager?

You can still use the Three Jobs to own the work you do have a say in, while working to expand your influence.

Q: *How does this work with SaFE?*   
A: "I have yet to see it work" for the Complex domain, it seems better suited for Complicated work ("I don't know this, but we have an expert who does").

Q: *Where's the line between the work of a Scrum Master and a Manager?*  
A: It depends on the team's capabilities.

### Leadership Agility model

Managers progress from **Expert** to **Achiever** to **Catalyst**. (Does this line up with [ShuHaRi](https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/ShuHaRi.html)?)

## The Power of the Pivot: Agile companies are built for times like these

with [Howard Sublett](https://twitter.com/howardsublett)

+ The earliest maps from history show complete certainty about the world, an attempt to convey the authority of the person who made the map.
+ When people got over themselves and began indicating areas of uncertainty on their maps (thar be dragons), it sparked a sense of adventure for people to begin exploring. 
+ Saying "here's something we don't know" in public leads to *action*.

### Draw Your Seamonsters

+ declare what you don't know
+ push decision-making to the edges/front lines of your organization, so your people are inspired to explore!

## A Deeper Dive into the ScrumMaster Role

with [Richard Cheng](https://www.scrumalliance.org/community/profile/rcheng2)

### Five qualities to look for in a Scrum Master/Agile Team Coach

1. Knowledge
1. Experience
1. Coaching
1. Facilitation
1. Servant Leadership

> A good Scrum Master is always on the verge of getting fired.

&mdash;Ken Schwaber

(This is likely because a good Scrum Master has to be able to be direct and have [difficult conversations](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/difficult-conversations/id1345042626?i=1000475171939) with managers and leaders.)

[Scrum Master checklist](https://scrummasterchecklist.org/pdf/ScrumMaster_Checklist_12_unbranded.pdf)

### How to evaluate the work of a Scrum Master?

#### How is the Product Owner doing?

+ Is the Product Backlog clear and in good order?
+ Are they setting effective Sprint Goals?
+ Are they transparent with the Stakeholders and Team (on their vision, roadmap, progress, etc.)?
+ Are they balancing feature delivery with the reduction of technical debt and other risks?

#### How is the team doing?

+ Are they using good agile engineering practices? (TDD, automation, pairing, etc.)
+ Do they self-organize and collaborate well?
+ How do they rank on the [DevOps Four Key Metrics](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/four-key-metrics)?

#### How is the organization doing?

+ Are communication barriers between departments or other silos coming down?
+ This is typically Agile Coach territory, but the Scrum Master should still have a seat at the table.

### The Scrum Master job

Is it a full-time job? **Yes**.  
Should a Scrum Master work across multiple teams? **No**. (Remember that **Focus** is a Scrum value)
